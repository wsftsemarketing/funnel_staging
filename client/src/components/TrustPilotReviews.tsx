This was only my 2nd coaching session, but i found it be to valuable. Geraldine showed me an excellent way to step out of my comfort zone and take the next step in my property journey. I found her to be highly engaging and listened to my ideas for next phase of my journey to flesh out.",

    text: "I'm excited to share how John has been a huge help in my journey with property investments. His dedication and deep knowledge have been crucial in guiding me through my property journey. \n Today's 1-2-1 session was really eye-opening. John gave me clear and practical advice that improved my understanding and plans. He has a real talent for making complex ideas simple and easy to follow. John doesn‚Äôt just fix immediate issues; he also prepares you for future challenges with confidence. He genuinely wants to help others succeed, and you can see this in the enthusiasm and personal attention he gives in every 1-2-1 session. \n If you're starting or want to grow in the property world, I highly recommend John. His guidance is more than helpful; it changes the game. Thank you, John, for your consistent support and expertise!.",

    text: "Touchstone Education are very helpful, friendly and professional with a wealth of knowledge! They have weekly Q&A's with 2 of the coaches, where all questions raised are answered and discussed as topics interactively during the hour plus long calls, giving insightful advice on their experiences etc. The operations team are quick to get back to you with any issues as well and reached out to me when I hadn't logged in for a week because of holiday which I thought was good. You also get a monthly 1-2-1 with a choice of one of the coaches to act as a mentor / accountability coach, I joined in March, I've had two 1-2-1 with Geraldine Murphy, lovely lady, gives you achievable targets to meet, gives you the drive to work harder and very easy to speak to! So far my journey has been great, just need to keep working at it!",

    text: "My wife and I joined the Touchstone Wealth program in early 2024 after the 2-day ‚ÄúWealth through Property‚Äù workshop. Since joining we have made use of the online courses (brilliant), in-person deal clinics (just blooming superb), on-line weekly Q&A sessions (always informative), and multiple 1-2-1 coaching sessions. I‚Äôd like to call out a few coaches for a special mention: Beth Bird has been incredible thanks to her ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude and down to earth style of coaching. In fact, it was Beth‚Äôs testimonial that convinced us to sign up to the program all those months ago. She‚Äôs just inspirational. John Davidson just has so, so much experience in pretty much every property strategy you can think of. What‚Äôs more, he is always so eager to share his expertise with everyone. He is a simply a stand-out coach. Rob Cottingham is relatively new in the Touchstone team but wow what a stunning journey so far. In just a few months he has grown a hugely successful property business and manages to spare time to help coach and mentor others. Thank you to the entire Touchstone team. I was initially sceptical but am totally convinced that they can and will help any budding property investors to succeed. Onwards and upwards!",

    text: "The energy of the two days was really good. Abi and Gordie gave really good insight into a lot of strategies around property investment and the starting points for each strategy. I was able to take away some great ideas and starting points in my new journey as a property investor. The biggest takeaway (asides signing up for the Wealth Academy!) was how much I need to open my eyes up to what I‚Äôm doing. The pensions section made my blood boil so I‚Äôm so pleased to be aware and now part of the Academy to truly understand the intricacies of this to have a more prosperous life).",

Having now completed my initial 1:1 I have a clear direction, my confidence has grown exponentially and I cannot wait to get started on this exciting journey. The information and advise I have received from Beth was excellent and she has most definitely set me up for success. I cannot recommend Beth enough she is an excellent coach.",

John gently reminded me of the value in looking back at how far I've come, not just how far there is to go‚Äîsomething that will stay with me when progress feels slow. Thank you John, for your kindness, insight, and encouragement when I needed it most. You're a genuine pleasure to talk to and an absolute credit to Touchstone. A big shout out to Indy, Dee and Chris also, all of whom have been great and provided support at various 1:1s :).",
