    question: "Is this webinar really free?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely! This webinar is completely free to attend. We believe in providing value first and helping you understand the potential of equity release for property investment. There are no hidden costs or mandatory purchases."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to own my home outright to benefit from this?",
    answer: "Not at all! Whether you own your home outright or still have a mortgage, you can potentially access your equity. We'll show you various strategies that work for different situations, including remortgaging options and equity release products suitable for your circumstances."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm approaching retirement - is this still relevant?",
    answer: "Absolutely! In fact, many of our most successful students are approaching or already in retirement. We'll cover age-appropriate strategies including pension-led funding, later-life lending options, and how to create passive income streams that complement your retirement planning."
  },
  {
    question: "How much equity do I need in my home to get started?",
    answer: "This varies depending on your strategy, but generally, having Â£100,000+ in equity opens up good opportunities. However, we'll show you methods that work with smaller amounts too, and how to maximize what you have through strategic property investment."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I receive a recording if I can't attend live?",
    answer: "Yes! All registered attendees will receive access to the full recording within 24 hours of the live webinar, plus exclusive bonus materials including our Equity Release Property Investment Guide and calculators to help you get started."
  },
  {
    question: "Is property investment risky with my home as security?",
    answer: "This is an excellent question and exactly what we'll address in detail. We'll cover risk mitigation strategies, conservative approaches, and how to protect your primary residence while building wealth. Safety and security are our top priorities when using home equity."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need prior property investment experience?",
    answer: "Not at all! This webinar is designed for complete beginners through to experienced investors. We start with the basics of equity release and build up to advanced strategies. Many of our most successful students started with zero property experience."
  },
  {
    question: "Will this affect my ability to pass my home to my children?",
    answer: "Great question! We'll show you strategies that can actually increase the inheritance you leave behind. By using your equity wisely to build a property portfolio, you could potentially leave your family much more wealth than just your primary residence."
